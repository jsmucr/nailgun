nailgun
=======

Nailgun is a client, protocol, and server for running Java programs from
the command line without incurring the JVM startup overhead.

Programs run in the server (which is implemented in Java), and are 
triggered by the client (written in C), which handles all I/O.

Use

    gradle build
	
to build the application from source.
